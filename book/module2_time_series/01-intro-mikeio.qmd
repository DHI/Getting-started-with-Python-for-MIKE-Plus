# Introduction to MIKE IO

MIKE IO (`mikeio`) is a powerful open-source Python library developed by DHI. It's your primary tool for interacting with various MIKE file formats programmatically. In this module, we'll focus on its capabilities for handling `.dfs0` time series files.

## What is MIKE IO?

[MIKE IO](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio) allows you to read, write, and manipulate data stored in common DHI file formats, such as:

*   `.dfs0` (time series data, our focus)
*   `.dfs1`, `.dfs2`, `.dfs3` (gridded data over 1, 2, or 3 dimensions)
*   `.dfsu` (flexible mesh data)
*   `.mesh` (mesh files)

It bridges the gap between DHI's modeling software and the rich Python ecosystem for data analysis and visualization.

## Why use MIKE IO?

Using `mikeio` offers several advantages:

*   **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks involving MIKE data files, such as extracting data, processing, and generating reports.
*   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate MIKE data with other Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for advanced analysis and visualization.
*   **Custom Workflows:** Develop custom data processing and analysis workflows tailored to your specific needs.
*   **Reproducibility:** Enhance the reproducibility of your work by scripting your data handling steps.

## Installation

We'll use `uv`, our package manager introduced in Module 1, to install `mikeio`.

1.  **Open your project terminal** in VS Code (ensure your project's virtual environment, e.g., `.venv`, is activated).
2.  **Install `mikeio`** by running:

    ```powershell
    uv pip install mikeio
    ```

3.  **Verify the installation** by checking the installed packages or running a small Python snippet:

    ```powershell
    uv pip list
    ```

    You should see `mikeio` and its version listed. Alternatively, you can run a Python script or in a Python interactive session:

    ```python
    import mikeio
    print(f"MIKE IO version: {mikeio.__version__}")
    ```

## Virtual Environments Reminder
Always ensure your project's virtual environment (e.g., managed by `uv`) is activated in your terminal before installing or importing packages. This keeps your project dependencies isolated and manageable.

## Core Concepts: DFS Files

DHI's Data File System (`.dfs`) is a family of file formats used to store various types of data. For this module, we are interested in:

*   **dfs0 files:** These files store time series data. Each file can contain one or more "items" (variables, e.g., water level, discharge) recorded over a sequence of time steps.
    *   **Items:** Represent the quantities being measured or simulated (e.g., "Water Level at Station A", "Rainfall"). Each item has a name, a type (e.g., Water Level), and a unit (e.g., meters).
    *   **Time Axis:** A sequence of datetimes defining when each data point for the items was recorded.

## Key `mikeio` Functionality (Overview)

`mikeio` provides a comprehensive API for working with DFS files. Some key functionalities include:

*   **Reading data:** Loading data from DFS files into Python objects (often `DataArray` or `Dataset` objects, which can be easily converted to Pandas DataFrames).
*   **Writing data:** Creating new DFS files or modifying existing ones with data from Python.
*   **Accessing metadata:** Retrieving information about the file, such as item names, units, time step details, and geographical information (for spatial data types).
*   **Data selection:** Efficiently reading only specific items or time ranges from large files.

We will explore these functionalities in the upcoming sections, starting with reading `.dfs0` files.

## Exploring MIKE IO Documentation

The official [MIKE IO documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio) is an excellent resource. It contains:

*   Installation guides.
*   Examples and tutorials (often as Jupyter Notebooks).
*   API reference detailing all functions and classes.

You are encouraged to visit the documentation to learn more about `mikeio`'s capabilities beyond what's covered in this course. For instance, the [Examples section](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio/tree/main/examples) can be very insightful.
