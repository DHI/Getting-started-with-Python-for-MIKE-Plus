# Introduction

## Welcome to Module 2

This module focuses on working with time series data, a crucial aspect of environmental modeling within the DHI ecosystem. You'll learn how to read, manipulate, analyze, and validate time series data using powerful Python libraries like `mikeio`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `tsod`. Building on the foundational skills from Module 1, you'll gain practical experience in handling real-world time series datasets.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Read time series data from dfs0 files into pandas DataFrames using `mikeio`.
- Select and filter time series data based on items and time indices.
- Resample time series data using `pandas`.
- Detect and handle anomalies in time series data using `tsod`.
- Fill missing data in time series.
- Create dfs0 files from pandas DataFrames.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into the following sections:

1.  **`mikeio` Overview and Installation:** Learn about the `mikeio` package and how to install it in your existing environment.
2.  **Reading DFS0 Data:** Reading dfs0 files into pandas DataFrames and selecting specific data.
3.  **Time Series Selection and Resampling:** Manipulating time series data including data selection, resampling, and indexing.
4.  **`tsod` Overview and Anomaly Detection:** Learn about the `tsod` package and its usage.
5.  **Data Cleaning:** Detect anomalies, filling missing data.
6.  **Creating DFS0 Files:** Creating dfs0 files from pandas DataFrames.
7.  **Homework:** Practice what you've learned with hands-on exercises.

## Prerequisites

-   Basic understanding of Python syntax and data structures (covered in Module 1).
-   Familiarity with `pandas` DataFrames (covered in Module 1).
-   Working knowledge of Visual Studio Code and your terminal environment (covered in Module 1).
