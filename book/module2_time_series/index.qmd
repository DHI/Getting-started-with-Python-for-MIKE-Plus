# Welcome to Module 2! {.unnumbered}

This module launches you into the practical world of time series data, a fundamental component of nearly all MIKE+ modelling projects. Our focus is on empowering you to efficiently handle, analyze, and prepare time series for your MIKE+ workflows:

- Convert dfs0 to Pandas DataFrame
- Select, resample, and clean data
- Visualize time series data
- Convert Pandas DataFrame to dfs0

You'll build on your knowledge of Pandas, and be introduced to a new library: MIKE IO. Let's go!
