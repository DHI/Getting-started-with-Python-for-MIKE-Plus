# Welcome to Module 2: Time Series! {.unnumbered}

In this module, you'll dive into working with time series data, a fundamental aspect of hydrological modeling and analysis. We will focus on `dfs0` files, the standard DHI format for time series, and leverage the power of Python packages like *mikeio* to read and *pandas* to manipulate this data. For instance, reading a `dfs0` file and preparing it for `pandas` can be conceptually straightforward:

```python
#| output: false
#| echo: fenced
# Conceptual: Reading a dfs0 file
import mikeio
dfs_data = mikeio.read("data/sample.dfs0")
# df = dfs_data.to_dataframe() # Convert to pandas DataFrame for analysis
```

You'll also get an introduction to *tsod* for basic data validation, enhancing the quality and reliability of your time series.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the role and benefits of the *mikeio* package for handling DHI file formats.
- Install and set up *mikeio* and *tsod* in your existing Python environment.
- Read time series data from `dfs0` files into *pandas* DataFrames.
- Select specific items (variables) and time periods from your time series data.
- Resample time series data to different temporal resolutions using *pandas*.
- Perform basic data validation by detecting and handling outliers/anomalies using *tsod* and *pandas*.
- Create new `dfs0` files from *pandas* DataFrames.

## Focus on Practical Application
This module emphasizes hands-on application. You'll not only learn *about* these tools but actively *use* them to manage and prepare your time series data effectively.

## Relevance to Your Work

Effectively managing time series data is crucial for tasks such as preparing model inputs (e.g., rainfall, boundary conditions), analyzing model outputs, and calibrating your MIKE+ models. This module will equip you with Python skills to automate and enhance these workflows, moving beyond manual data processing and improving the efficiency and reproducibility of your work.

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have completed Module 1 or are comfortable with:

- Basic Python syntax and data types.
- Working with *pandas* DataFrames (creating, selecting, basic operations).
- Using Visual Studio Code as your IDE.
- Managing Python environments and packages with *uv*.
- Navigating your system using the terminal.

Let's begin enhancing your time series data handling capabilities!
