# Welcome to Module 2: Time Series Data! {.unnumbered}

In this module, we'll dive into the world of time series data, a fundamental data type in many engineering and scientific fields, especially when working with DHI's MIKE software. You'll learn how to manage, analyze, and visualize time series data using Python, building upon the foundational skills you acquired in Module 1.

Our focus will be on:

1.  **MIKE IO (`mikeio`):** Understanding and using this key DHI package to read and write `.dfs0` files, the standard format for time series data in the MIKE ecosystem.
2.  **Pandas for Time Series:** Leveraging the power of Pandas to manipulate, select, and resample time series data effectively.
3.  **Plotting:** Creating insightful visualizations of your time series data using `matplotlib` via Pandas.
4.  **Data Validation (`tsod`):** Introducing basic data validation techniques, including anomaly detection and data cleaning using the `tsod` package.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to confidently import time series data from `.dfs0` files, perform common analytical tasks, validate your data, and export your results back to `.dfs0` format.

Don’t worry if some concepts seem new; we'll build them step-by-step, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to practice.

## Python Packages for This Module

We will be using the following core Python packages in this module. If you followed Module 1, your environment should be ready. We'll cover installation for `mikeio` and `tsod` as we introduce them.

| [![Pandas](/images/logos/pandas_logo.png){width="150"}](https://pandas.pydata.org/)                    | Powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, especially for tabular data and time series. We'll focus on its time series features. |
| [![Matplotlib](/images/logos/matplotlib_logo.png){width="150"}](https://matplotlib.org/)               | A comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. Used by Pandas for plotting.       |
| [![MIKE IO](/images/logos/MIKE-IO-Logo-Pos-RGB-nomargin.png){width="185"}](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio) | DHI's open-source Python library to read, write, and manipulate MIKE files like `.dfs0`, `.dfs1`, `.dfs2`, `.dfs3`, `.dfsu`, and `.mesh`.    |
| `tsod`                                                                                                 | A Python package for time series outlier detection, useful for data validation and cleaning. (Assumed DHI-related or commonly used)     |

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have:

*   Completed Module 1 or are comfortable with:
    *   Setting up and using Visual Studio Code.
    *   Basic terminal/PowerShell commands.
    *   Managing Python environments and packages with `uv`.
    *   Fundamental Python syntax (variables, data types, functions, imports).
    *   Basic Pandas operations (creating DataFrames, selecting columns, simple filtering – as covered in Module 1 with CSV data).
*   Access to course materials, including any provided `.dfs0` sample files.

Let's begin by exploring `mikeio`!
