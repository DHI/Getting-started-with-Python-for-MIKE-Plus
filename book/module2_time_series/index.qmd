# Welcome to Module 2! {.unnumbered}

- In this module, we'll dive into handling time series data, a cornerstone of working with MIKE+ models and hydrological/environmental data.
- You'll learn how to use powerful Python packages like *mikeio* to read and write DHI's native *.dfs0* time series files, *pandas* for data manipulation and analysis, *matplotlib* for visualization, and *tsod* for basic data validation.
- This module builds directly on the foundational skills you developed in Module 1, including your setup of VS Code, *uv*, and basic Python/*pandas* knowledge.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose and basic usage of the *mikeio* library for interacting with *.dfs0* files.
- Read time series data from *.dfs0* files into *pandas* DataFrames.
- Select specific data items and time periods from your time series.
- Create basic plots of time series data using *pandas* and *matplotlib*.
- Resample time series data to different temporal resolutions.
- Understand the purpose and basic usage of the *tsod* library for time series outlier detection.
- Perform basic data validation tasks, such as identifying and handling outliers or missing data.
- Create new *.dfs0* files from *pandas* DataFrames.

## Module Structure
This module is structured as follows:
1.  **Introduction to *mikeio***: Understanding the *mikeio* package and its role in the DHI ecosystem.
2.  **Reading *.dfs0* Files**: How to load time series data from *.dfs0* files into *pandas* DataFrames.
3.  **Selecting Time Series Data**: Techniques for selecting specific items and time ranges from your data, both with *mikeio* and *pandas*.
4.  **Plotting Time Series Data**: Basic visualization of time series using *pandas* built-in plotting capabilities (which use *matplotlib*).
5.  **Resampling Time Series**: Changing the frequency of your time series data (e.g., from hourly to daily).
6.  **Introduction to *tsod***: Getting acquainted with the *tsod* package for time series outlier detection.
7.  **Data Validation and Cleaning**: Applying *tsod* for anomaly detection and methods for handling missing data (`NaN` values).
8.  **Creating *.dfs0* Files**: Writing your processed *pandas* DataFrames back into the *.dfs0* format.
9.  **Homework**: Practical exercises to solidify your understanding and skills.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1, including:
    - Setup of VS Code, *uv*, and a Python environment.
    - Basic familiarity with the terminal/PowerShell.
    - Fundamental Python concepts (variables, data types, functions, importing modules).
    - Basic *pandas* operations (DataFrame creation, selection, simple manipulations - as covered in Module 1).
    - Basic *matplotlib* plotting (as introduced in Module 1).
- Access to a working MIKE+ installation is beneficial for context but not strictly required for most exercises in this module.
- Course project folder set up as per Module 1 instructions.

## Python Packages Used in this Module
We will be working primarily with the following Python packages. Installation will be covered where new.
-   ***mikeio***: For reading and writing DHI-specific file formats, especially *.dfs0*.
-   ***pandas***: For data manipulation and analysis of time series.
-   ***matplotlib***: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python (used by *pandas* for plotting).
-   ***tsod***: For time series outlier detection.
-   ***numpy***: Often used implicitly with *pandas* (e.g., for `np.nan`).

## Video - Module 2 Overview (5-10 min)
- This video will provide a brief walkthrough of the topics covered in Module 2, highlight the key skills you'll acquire, and show how this module fits into your journey of automating workflows with Python and DHI tools.
