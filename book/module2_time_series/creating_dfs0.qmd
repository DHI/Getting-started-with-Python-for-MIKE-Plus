# Creating DFS0 Files from Pandas DataFrames

## Section Introduction

This section explains how to convert your cleaned pandas DataFrame back into a dfs0 file using `mikeio`. After performing data cleaning, analysis, or manipulation, you'll often want to save your results back into a dfs0 file for use in MIKE+ or other DHI software. This section provides the necessary steps to accomplish this conversion seamlessly.

## Key Concepts: Creating DFS0 Files

Creating a dfs0 file from a pandas DataFrame involves two main steps. First, you need to create a `mikeio.Dataset` object from your DataFrame. This can be done using the `.from_dataframe()` method, which automatically infers the item names and data types from the DataFrame columns. Alternatively, you can manually create a `mikeio.Dataset` by specifying the item names and units explicitly. This manual method is useful when you need to add metadata or ensure that the item names and units are correct.

Next, you create a `Dfs0` object and save it to a file using the `.write()` method. This method takes the filename as an argument and saves the data to a new dfs0 file. You can also specify additional metadata, such as the item units, when creating the `Dfs0` object. For detailed guides, refer to the [official `mikeio` documentation](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio).
