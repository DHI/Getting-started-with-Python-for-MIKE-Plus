# `tsod` Overview and Anomaly Detection

## Section Introduction

This section introduces the `tsod` package, a valuable tool for time series outlier detection. The `tsod` package helps you identify anomalies and outliers in your time series data, which is a crucial step in data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Key Concepts: `tsod` Installation

To begin using `tsod`, you'll first need to install it within your existing Python environment. You can do this easily using `uv pip install tsod`. For more detailed information on installing Python packages, refer to the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/). After installation, it's important to verify that `tsod` is installed correctly. You can do this by opening your terminal, typing `python` to enter the interactive Python interpreter, and then typing `import tsod`. If no errors are raised, the package has been successfully installed.

## Key Concepts: Anomaly Detection with `tsod`

The primary purpose of `tsod` is to facilitate identifying anomalies and outliers in time series data. One of the simplest anomaly detection methods is using a rolling window to calculate statistics, such as the standard deviation, and then flagging values that fall outside a certain range. For detailed guides and more advanced anomaly detection techniques, see the [`tsod` documentation](https://tsod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Key functionalities include various anomaly detection algorithms, visualization tools, and methods for handling missing data.

## Link Guidance

For detailed information and examples, refer to the official [`tsod` documentation](https://tsod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The documentation provides comprehensive guides on installation, usage, and the various features offered by the `tsod` package.
