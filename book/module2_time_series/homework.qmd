# Module 2: Time Series - Homework

## Instructions

Complete the following exercises to reinforce your understanding of time series analysis using `mikeio`, `pandas`, and `tsod`. Save your code in a Jupyter Notebook and submit the notebook file.

## Exercise 1

1.  **Download Data:** Download time series data (e.g., rainfall data) in CSV format from a public source (e.g., a government weather website).
2.  **Read into DataFrame:** Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Inspect the data to verify the column and date format.
3.  **Cleaning:** Clean the data of missing values or obvious errors.
4.  **Convert to DFS0:** Convert the DataFrame to a dfs0 file using `mikeio`.

## Exercise 2

1.  **Simulated Flow Data:** Create a synthetic flow meter time series with simulated outliers and missing data.
2.  **`tsod` for Anomaly Detection:** Use `tsod` to detect and replace the anomalies with `NaN`.
3.  **Interpolation:** Fill the `NaN` values using linear interpolation.
4.  **Resampling:** Resample to a weekly scale.

## Exercise 3

1. **Reading Data:** Read the example dfs0 from exercise 1 into a pandas dataframe.
2. **Visualization:** Plot the rainfall data from the DataFrame using `matplotlib`. Add labels and title.
3. **Statistic Calculations:** Calculate and print descriptive statistics (mean, std, min, max) for the data.

## Submission Guidelines

-   Submit your Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file containing the solutions to the exercises.
-   Include clear and concise comments in your code to explain your steps.
-   Ensure your code is executable and produces the expected outputs.
