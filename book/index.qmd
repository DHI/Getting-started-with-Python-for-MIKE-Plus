# Introduction {.unnumbered}

DHI offers a range of free, open-source Python libraries that enable automated and reproducible MIKE+ workflows, as well as unlock the potential for robust and flexible analyses. This course is designed for experienced MIKE+ modelers who are new to Python, providing a practical foundation to begin applying concepts to real projects. You’ll gain essential skills to read, run, and modify Python scripts relevant to MIKE+ modelling through focused, hand-tailored examples. The course will orient you to a new way of working, guiding you through the transition from a GUI to a script-based environment, helping you navigate common challenges, and giving you the confidence to continue exploring Python and seek out resources to further develop your skills.

## Why Python with MIKE+?

Using Python alongside MIKE+ provides the following advantages:

- Efficient handling of various file types, including dfs0, res1d, and xns11
- Conversion of data between MIKE+ and third-party formats such as CSV and Excel
- Flexibility to modify MIKE+ databases, access tools, and run simulations
- Automation of modelling tasks using a straightforward scripting syntax
- Reproducible and documented workflows that enhance model quality assurance

## Intended Audience

This course is ideal for MIKE+ modelers who:

- Are eager to explore Python’s potential in MIKE+ modelling
- Want to enhance, automate, or document parts of their workflows with Python
- Seek more flexible and robust techniques for advanced modelling needs

## Course Structure

The course focuses on practical applications of Python for common MIKE+ modelling tasks. Content generally consists of a combination of videos, live sessions, and hands-on exercises. We will cover Python libraries such as MIKE IO, MIKE IO 1D, and MIKE+Py.

Module 1 | Foundations
: Topics: Python and Python Packages, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, LLMs for coding, Pandas, Matplotlib, Documentation

Module 2 | Time Series
: Topics: dfs0 files, plotting, statistics, selections, resampling, basic data validation

Module 3 | Network Results
: Topics: network result files (e.g. res1d, res, res11), selecting data, extracting results, geospatial formats (e.g. shapefiles)

Module 4 | Calibration Plots and Statistics
: Topics: basic statistics and plots relevant for model calibration

Module 5 | MIKE+Py
: Topics: databases and SQL, modifying MIKE+ databases, accessing GUI tools, running simulations

Module 6 | Putting Everything Together
: Topics: final project applying lessons of previous modules.

## Course Objectives

After completing this course, you should be able to:

- Install Python and related packages for use with MIKE+
- Apply Python to create reproducible and automated workflows
- Explore documentation and run example notebooks and scripts
- Connect with the open-source Python community and MIKE+ modelers
