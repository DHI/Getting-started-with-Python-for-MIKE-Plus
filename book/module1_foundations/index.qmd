# Welcome to Module One! {.unnumbered}

In this module, you'll gain the skills to confidently set up your coding environment, access course materials, and run Python code with ease. Our focus is on:

1. Mastering essential tools (e.g. GitHub, Visual Studio Code, uv).
2. Running and understanding Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
3. Learning basic Python syntax and concepts.
4. Exploring core libraries (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) for data analysis.

Don’t worry if it feels fast-paced — you’ll practice these concepts in later modules. Let’s get you set up and ready to dive in!
