# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website for storing, sharing, and collaborating on software development projects. It's an especially popular platform for [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). DHI uses GitHub for hosting its entire open-source Python ecosystem, including documentation and examples.

## DHI's Python Ecosystem on GitHub

DHI's Python ecosystem is organized into modular Python packages based on functionality. This is a common pattern in Python that empowers users to flexibly combine functionalities to meet specific project needs. An overview of Python packages useful for MIKE+ modelling is provided in the table below.

| Package | Description |
|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| [![MIKE IO](/images/logos\MIKE-IO-Logo-Pos-RGB-nomargin.png){width="185"}](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio) | Read, write and manipulate dfs0, dfs1, dfs2, dfs3, dfsu and mesh files. |
| [![MIKE IO 1D](/images/logos\MIKE-IO-1D-Logo-Pos-RGB-nomargin.png){width="185"}](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio1d) | Read, manipulate, and analyze res1d, res, resx, out, and xns11 files. |
| [![MIKE+Py](/images/logos\mikeplus-py.png){width="217"}](https://github.com/DHI/mikepluspy) | MIKE+Py is a python interface for MIKE+. |
| [![ModelSkill](/images/logos\modelskill.png){width="300" height="50"}](https://github.com/DHI/modelskill) | Compare MIKE model results and observations. |
| [![TSOD](/images/logos\tsod.png){width="171"}](https://github.com/DHI/tsod) | Anomaly Detection for time series data. |

Feel free to browse additional open-source packages on [DHI's GitHub profile](https://github.com/DHI).

## Why visit a Python package's GitHub page?

You'll use GitHub for:

* Accessing documentation and examples.
* Creating 'issues' and/or 'discussions' when you need help.
* Checking out changes with new package versions.
* Browsing source code and/or contributing code you think is generally useful.
