# Homework {.unnumbered}

**Exercise 1**

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Find and explore the *mikeio1d* repository. Can you find its documentation?
3. What's the current version of *mikeio1d*?
4. Search around GitHub and *star* some repositories you think are cool.

**Exercise 2**

1. Make a new folder somewhere on your PC.
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a virtual environment in that folder using *uv* from VS Code's terminal.
3. Install *mikeio1d* in the virtual environment using *uv*.
4. List all the packages in the virtual environment. Do you recognize any?
5. Select the Python Interpreter in VS Code to be the virtual environment you created.

**Exercise 3**

1. From VS Code, create a new file under the project folder created in exercise two.
2. Copy the following code into the script:
```{python}
#| output: false
import mikeio1d

print("I'm a script that uses mikeio1d version " + mikeio1d.__version__)
```
3. Run the script from VS Code's terminal using *uv*.
4. Run the script from VS Code's user interface (i.e. via the 'Run' menu).
5. Do you get the same output for steps 3 and 4?

**Exercise 4**

1. Install `ipykernel` into the same virtual environment of the previous exercises.
2. Create a new Jupyter Notebook from within VS Code.
3. Make sure the kernel matches your virtual environment, otherwise update it.
4. Paste the code from exercise three into a code cell.
5. Run the cell created in the previous step. Does the output match that of exercise three?

**Exercise 5**

1. Install the package `cowsay`into your virtual environment.
2. Create a new script, and import the function `cow` from `cowsay`.
3. Make a list containing the names of three countries you want to visit.
4. Loop over the list, and invoke the function `cow` by passing the current element of the list.
5. Run the script. What do you see?
6. Try to get the same output in a jupyter notebook by using two code cells.

**Exercise 6**

1. Download the following csv file into your project folder: TODO: Add link
2. Install `pandas` and `matplotlib` into your virtual environment.
3. Create a new Jupyter Notebook and import pandas
4. Load the downloaded csv file into a *DataFrame* using pandas.
5. Calculate the minimum, mean, and maximum values.
6. Plot the DataFrame. Do the values calculated from the previous step make sense?
